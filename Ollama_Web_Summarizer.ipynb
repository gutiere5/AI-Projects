    "# Webpage Summarizer with Ollama and Llama 3.2\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a simple yet powerful workflow for summarizing any webpage using a locally-run Large Language Model (LLM) with Ollama.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The process is as follows:**\n",
    "1.  Input a URL of a webpage.\n",
    "2.  The notebook fetches the HTML content of the page.\n",
    "3.  It uses the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML and extract the main text content, cleaning out irrelevant tags like scripts, styles, and images.\n",
    "4.  It constructs a prompt containing the extracted text.\n",
    "5.  It sends this prompt to a locally running Ollama model (`llama3.2`) to generate a concise summary.\n",
    "6.  The final summary is displayed in a clean, readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap on installation of Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and install!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once complete, the ollama server should already be running locally.  \n",
    "If you visit:  \n",
    "[http://localhost:11434/](http://localhost:11434/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see the message `Ollama is running`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If not, bring up a new Terminal (Mac) or Powershell (Windows) and enter `ollama serve`  \n",
    "And in another Terminal (Mac) or Powershell (Windows), enter `ollama pull llama3.2`  \n",
    "Then try [http://localhost:11434/](http://localhost:11434/) again.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Ollama is slow on your machine, try using `llama3.2:1b` as an alternative. Run `ollama pull llama3.2:1b` from a Terminal or Powershell, and change the code below from `MODEL = \"llama3.2\"` to `MODEL = \"llama3.2:1b\"`"
